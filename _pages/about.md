Welcome! I'm Paul, a PhD student at the [Polytechnic Institute of Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/) in collaboration with [Orange](https://www.orange.com), France's leading ISP.

My research centers on collecting Linux system telemetry to build provenance graphs, which capture the origin, evolution, and relationships of the systems activity. This approach has various uses cases in security, including threat detection through graph queries and embedding comparisons and forensic analysis for threat hunting or post-incident auditing.
