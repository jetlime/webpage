#Graphical User Interface monitoring Application testing

Applications such as software or web-based programs prove to be fallacious, certain functionalities of these applications could wrongly execute their task or just not work at all. Therefore, these applications need to be tested regularly in order to verify the quality of the product and the security evolving around it. Tests are based on multiple interaction between the testing software and the application, it can either fail or pass.
The main objective of the Bachelor Semester Project will be to create a graphical user interface (called GUI), it represents the status of the test executed on the applications. The GUI is a web based user-friendly platform that represents various data collected around different tests. The interface will represent statistics of the tests such as how long the test lasted, if the test failed or passed, and the passed/fail ratio. The results will be classified and properly represented.

This interface works with a node.js server.
Thus, you need to turn on the server in order to properly use the interface.

Turn on the server:
Open the openserver.bat file, this file will open the index.js file with the nodemon library.

The server is now turned on.
The traffic between the server and the webpage will be displayed on the opened command prompt.
